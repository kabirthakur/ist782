Required Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(imputeTS)
set.seed(500)
```

Importing datasets

```{r}
data=read_csv("HMO_data.csv")
```

Understanding and exploring the data

```{r}
head(data,10) #printing top 10 values of the data 
```


```{r}
str(data) #str gives us the structure of the data  
```

```{r}
summary(data) #summary gives us the statistical description of the data 
```

```{r}
unique(data$location) #unique is used to eliminate the duplicate values 
unique(data$location_type) 
unique(data$education_level)
unique(data$gender)
unique(data$children)
```

Finding NA values

```{r}
sum(is.na(data)) #finding the NA values in the dataframe
```

sum(is.na(data$education_level))
sum(is.na(data$yearly_physical))
sum(is.na(data$exercise))

#We can see that bmi and hypertension are the only two variables which have NA values. Both variables are numerical so we can run NA interpolation to get an approximate value for the data Correcting NA values
```

```{r}
# using na_interpolation to replace the variables having NA with approximate values 
data$bmi=na_interpolation(data$bmi)
data$hypertension=na_interpolation(data$hypertension)
sum(is.na(data))
# now the sum is zero, hence no NA values

#All predictors except location, location_type, education_level & marriage factors are significant variables to predict the health expense of an individual based on the dataset provided by the HMO.
# Overall Probability value is 2.2e-16 which is less than the standard alpha value. 
#The null hypothesis assumes B-weights of all predictors to be zero, and we got the values of coefficients significantly different from zero for all the predictor variables. Hence we reject null hypothesis that says the coefficient of B- weights are equal to 0.
# Adjusted R-squared value shows 0.42 which means 42% is accounted by all the outcome variables which measures of cost of healthcare expense done by an individual 
#Null hypothesis that affirmed that R-squared is 0 has a F-statistic (11,7570) as 509.7.
#The independent variables p value for age, bmi, children, smoker, yearly_physical check, exercise & gender shows p-value < provided alpha value.
#Hence, all the above variables shows high impact on the cost of health expenses consumed by a person.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
